# Knowledge-Injected Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification

This repository contains two model implementations for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification with knowledge injection:

- **LCR-Rot-hop-ont++**  
- **LCR-Rot-hop-Kfont++**

Each approach has its own folder with a dedicated README explaining how to run and reproduce the experiments.

Refer to the corresponding subdirectories for setup instructions and details.

To automatically execute the entire pipeline for training and evaluating all model configurations, you can run `run_all.py`. This script sequentially performs preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, training, and validation for all predefined combinations of domain, year, and ontology hops. This allows you to reproduce all results with a single command.
